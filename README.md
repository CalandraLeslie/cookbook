This is my cookbook application for my React class. I had my files staged locally and saved into the cloud, so that is why there is only one commit to main. 

*Functionaly* This application works when a user types in a letter, country, or specific types of meals in the search bar. It is then rendered to a page where all 
of the items from the search query come to a MealDetails component and when clicked on a specific picture, it takes the user to a new browser window on the MealList
component**

**This project contains**

**Hover functionality on the images revealed after using the search function**

**An extra search bar above the image listing if the user wants to search for something**

**CSS styling (both inline and on an external file - the inline because I could not get the styling to work on the MealList component)**

**Fully commented code**
